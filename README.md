# Project Description:

## CIS2023 Linux Final Project
Welcome to the CIS2023 Linux Final Project repository! This project demonstrates the fundamental skills acquired in the CIS 2023 course, focusing on Linux command-line operations, bash scripting, and version control using Git.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to create a bash script that prints numbers from 1 to 50. The script is designed to be efficient, demonstrating your understanding of basic bash scripting commands. Additionally, the project includes documentation and maintenance of the script using Git and GitHub.

## Repository Contents
- `print_numbers.sh`: A bash script that prints numbers from 1 to 50.
- `output.txt`: The captured output of the script execution for documentation purposes.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview, setup instructions, and detailed documentation of the project.

## How to Run the Script
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    git clone git@github.com:BenafshaShakari/CIS2023-Linux-FinalProject.git
    cd CIS2023-Linux-FinalProject
    

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
    
    chmod +x print_numbers.sh
    

3. **Run the Script**:
    
    ./print_numbers.sh
   

## Expected Output
When you run `print_numbers.sh`, you should see the following output in the terminal:

1
2
3
4
5
...
50




## Project Setup
1. **Repository Creation**: A public GitHub repository was created with the name `CIS2023-Linux-FinalProject`.
2. **Script Development**: A bash script `print_numbers.sh` was developed to meet the project requirements.
3. **Output File**: The output of the script was redirected to `output.txt` for documentation.
4. **Version Control**: The project was maintained using Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

## Screenshots
- **Terminal Commands**: Screenshots showing terminal interactions with the Git repository.
- **README.md**: Screenshot of this `README.md` file.
- **Script Execution**: Screenshot showing the execution of `print_numbers.sh`.

## Submission Requirements
To fulfill the project requirements, the following elements are included:
- **Bash Script**: The `print_numbers.sh` file attached as a text file.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.
- **Repository Link**: [CIS2023-Linux-FinalProject](https://github.com/BenafshaShakari/CIS2023-Linux-FinalProject).
